# Tic Tac Toe
## Like You've Never Seen it Before

### Rules
* Alternating turns, cross goes first
* Multiple win conditions:
    * Horizontal row
    * Vertical row
    * Diagonal line (corner to corner)
    * Box that is a quarter of the size of the board (rounded down for odd-number sized boards)
    * All 4 corners.

### Fun fact
You can adjust the size of the board by editing the `BOARD_SIZE` value in MainActivity.java.

### TODO
* Add slider to adjust board size at runtime
* Make board scale to fill screen
